#Work Day Scheuler Project
## Project Description
Using client's existing code, expand their Work Day Scheduler applicaiton using jQuery and Bootstrap libraries, which have also been provided. 

## Requirements
The client has requested the following features:
* When the planner is opened, the current day is displayed at the top.
* When the user scrolls down, they are presented with time blocks for standard business hours.
* When the user views time blocks for that day, each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.
* When the user clicks into a time block, they can enter an event.
* When the user clicks the Save button for that time block, the text for that event is saved in local storage.
* When the user refreshes the page, the saved events persist in localStorage.
